# kCal

Calendar extension for Kohana 3.

## Features

- Calendar view
- Assign events to dates or ranges of dates
- Err, whatever else you fancy really.

## Requirements;

**This class uses Twig (https://github.com/jonathangeiger/kohana-twig) to do the templating. I'll probably add in Kohana View support one day**

## Usage

See the controllers/kcalexamples.php for usage of the classage.
